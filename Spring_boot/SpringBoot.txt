1)what is springboot?
->Spring Boot is java framework that makes it easier to create and run java applicaitons.
->it simplifies the configuraion and setup process allowing devlopers to focus moore
 in writing code for their applicatins.
->Spring boot  a module of the spring framework ,it helps us rapid application development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
->Spring boot solve many problem
a)Configuration
b)Dependecy Mangement
Projet bna rha   web ki depenedecy chayiye (spring-boot-starter-web)
pom.xml daal denge apne app saridepenedency a jaye gi..auto configuraiotn noo need to do 
any other configarion ..only we have to use annotation and ready to go.
c)Embedded Server
It also provide embed server(Earlie we need to  do lot of congiguration on tomacat server set).
#)what is embedded server?
#)Concept of embedserve it hels in deploying our jar in easy way
#)Desutl is Tomcat


What is an Embedded Server? (Simple Answer)

An embedded server means the web server (like Tomcat, Jetty) is built inside the Spring Boot application JAR.
We don’t need to install or deploy the server separately.
Just run the JAR, and the server starts automatically.

✅ Example

In traditional Java:

❌ You need to install Tomcat on your machine
❌ Deploy WAR file into webapps folder
❌ Restart server manually

In Spring Boot:

✅ Just run:

java -jar myapp.jar


Spring Boot automatically starts an internal server:

Embedded Tomcat (default)

Or Jetty

Or Undertow

✅ Why is it called embedded?

Because the server is:

✅ Included inside your JAR
✅ Started by Spring Boot automatically
✅ Managed by your application, not separately

✅ Simple real example

Spring Boot uses this dependency:

spring-boot-starter-web


It includes:

✅ Embedded Tomcat
✅ That means Tomcat runs inside your application JAR file.

✅ Advantages of Embedded Server
✅ 1. No need to install external Tomcat

Everything is packaged.

✅ 2. Easy deployment

Just run the JAR anywhere.

✅ 3. Simplifies DevOps and microservices

Every service runs independently with its own server.

✅ 4. Faster startup

Because no WAR deployment is needed.

✅ 5. Supports microservice architecture

Each microservice has its own server.

✅ Simple interview line

“An embedded server is a server bundled inside the Spring Boot application.
When we run the JAR, the server starts automatically.
No external Tomcat installation or WAR deployment is required.”

✅ If interviewer asks: Which server does Spring Boot use?

Default Embedded Server:
✅ Tomcat

But you can switch to:

Jetty

Undertow

2)Why spring boot over spring?
#)spring based applications have a lots of configarion.
#)when we use spring mvc we need to config compoent scan ,dispatcher servlet .
world is moving towards Microservices.
#)We do not have a lot of time to set up 100 Microservices.
#)We can quiucily start the spring boot setup using starter.io and quicly setup integrate with jpa.
#)Springboot actuator help in monotorint the applicaiton.

1)Spring boot provide  many adavantages over  normal spring framework.

a) Easy to use -Remove boilerplate codes.
b)Production Ready application: Metrix ,health Check and many features aredesignes for produiton ready applicaiotn.
c)Rapid devlopemnt : Auto configuration enable develoers to quickly dvleop apps.
d)Provide Dependency Mangemnt : no need to manager separate dependices manually.in spring we need to manage depencies manualy
e)AutoConfiguration:Springboot autoconfiguration things by default.
f)Embedded server:Provide tomatserver by default. we don't need to manullay configuaration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3)Working of spring boot?
1)Spring boot starts by scanning the starter dependencies in pom.xml
download and auto-configuration the module as you included in pom.xml

dwonlaod  haar baar nhi hoga jb maven reload or build kre ge tbhi download hoga.
Ex: We have to create a web application then we have to put spring-boot-starter-web dependency in pox.xml 
when we start the project springboot download all the dependency require for web
and configure  the things like spring mvc.

4)HOw spring boot starts?
1)Start by caliing main method of main class
2)The run method of springApplication is called .the method starts the application
by creating an application context and initializing it.

#)what is annotians?



#)Top Spring boot Annotaions

1)@SpringBootApplication
we use @SpringBootApplication annotaon launch our application

✅ Tells Spring Boot to start the application
✅ Tells Spring Boot to scan all components in that package
✅ Performs auto-configuration
✅ Starts the embedded server (Tomcat)

#)This annotation combination  of three annotations
-->@SpringBootConfiguration ->we can configuration bean
-->@EnableAutoConfiguration:
    Tells Spring Boot to automatically configure the application based on dependencies (e.g., if you add Spring Web, it auto-configures Tomcat).
--> @ComponentScan ->here we want to check in package ke andar component  hai kya.
it is typically placed on the main class of the application.

#)@Component -> it is used to  mark a class as a spring bean that
will be managed by the spring container.

@Autowired: This annotion is used to automatically inject dependencies into
 a Spring-mangedbean.
Example likho kaise krte oh?
#)@Service:
This annotiaon is used to indicate that a class represent a service component in the application .it is typically used to annotate classes that 
contain business logic.

#)@RestController
Mark class as Rest Controller .it is a specialized version of the 
@Controller annotation that includes the @ResponseBody annotation by default.


#)@RequestMapping :used to map  specific url to method .Used on class as well as method level.
is used to map an HTTP request (like GET, POST, etc.) to a method or a class in a controller.
#)When this URL is called, run this method.


@ResponseBody

#)@Repository :mark class a DAO .mostly used on class that has databse persistent logic.

#)Wht are the spring boot starters?
Startes are a collection of pre-configured dependecncies that makes it a easier  to develop  particular kinds of applications










Bean ->
--------------------------------------------------------------------
#)How Spring Finds @Component Beans

Spring scans your project (using @ComponentScan) and automatically detects any class annotated with:

@Component

@Service

@Repository

@Controller

@RestController

This usually happens automatically in Spring Boot, because @SpringBootApplication includes @ComponentScan.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------




#)What are the Spring boot starters
Starters are a collection of pre-configured depencies that makes
it easier to develop particular kinds of aoolications.
spring-boot-starter-web => web se related sare  configuraiton and dependecy rlhu jaise  hi use kiya sb jldi se downlaod ho jata hai.
#) These startes include all of the dependecies ,version control and configarion needed to amke certain features of a speing boot  applicaiton funcitonal.
#)spring-boot-starter-web is a starter used to build web applications.
It brings Spring MVC, embedded Tomcat, and JSON support out of the box.”
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

What does it include?

provide defualt config for maven plugis such as maven-surfire

2)maven-plugin
3)sarter-test
4)starter-actuator
5)starter-web


#)maven

Q)Can we use only Spring boot dependecy feature  and configure  maven plugin manually?
1)Yes
2)

Q)What is spring boot cli and what are its benfits?
comamnd tool to creat run and amange spring boot applicasiotn
-->Spring
-->spring help init
--> spring version
-->Spring init --dependecncies=web data-jpa my-project
-->spring init --list
->spring  init -d web cli-project


Q)What  is Thymeleaf?
java -based server side  templating engine used in java web applications to
render dynamic web pages.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Profile
#)What is a Profile in Spring Boot? (Simple Answer)
A Profile in Spring Boot is a way to define different configurations for different environments — like dev, test, stage, prod.
You activate one profile at a time depending on where your application is running.

#)How do you have diffenrt configuaration for differnt enviroments?
we need to define individula env for each Profile
->application-dev.properties
in application.properties,
spring.profiles.active=prod


------------------------------------
#)Why do we use Profiles?

Because each environment needs different:
✅ Database URLs
✅ API URLs
✅ Logging levels
✅ Credentials
✅ Ports
✅ Feature flags

Profiles help us separate these cleanly.
--------------------------------------
Common example

You might have:

application-dev.properties
application-test.properties
application-prod.properties

-----------------------------------------------------
Inside application-dev.properties:

server.port=8081
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/dev_db


Inside application-prod.properties:

server.port=8080
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://prod-server:3306/prod_db



✅ Using @Profile annotation

You can activate beans only for specific environments:

@Service
@Profile("dev")
public class DevService {}

@Service
@Profile("prod")
public class ProdService {}


Only ONE of these will load based on active profile.


---------------------------------------
#)Spring Boot actuator?
Spring Boot Actuator gives production-ready monitoring and management endpoints for your application.
It helps you check the health, metrics, logs, environment, and other internals of your Spring Boot application.

How to enable Actuator?

Add dependency in pom.xml:

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
