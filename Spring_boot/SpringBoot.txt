1)what is springboot?
->Spring Boot is java framework that makes it easier to create and run java applicaitons.
->it simplifies the configuraion and setup process allowing devlopers to focus moore
 in writing code for their applicatins.
->Spring boot  a module of the spring framework ,it helps us rapid application development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
->Spring boot solve many problem
a)Configuration
b)Dependecy Mangement
Projet bna rha   web ki depenedecy chayiye (spring-boot-starter-web)
pom.xml daal denge apne app saridepenedency a jaye gi..auto configuraiotn noo need to do 
any other configarion ..only we have to use annotation and ready to go.
c)Embedded Server
It also provide embed server(Earlie we need to  do lot of congiguration on tomacat server set).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2)Why spring boot over spring?
1)Spring boot provide  many adavantages over  normal spring framework.

a) Easy to use -Remove boilerplate codes.
b)Production Ready application: Metrix ,health Check and many features aredesignes for produiton ready applicaiotn.
c)Rapid devlopemnt : Auto configuration enable develoers to quickly dvleop apps.
d)Provide Dependency Mangemnt : no need to manager separate dependices manually.in spring we need to manage depencies manualy
e)AutoConfiguration:Springboot autoconfiguration things by default.
f)Embedded server:Provide tomatserver by default.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3)Working of spring boot?
1)Spring boot starts by scanning the starter dependencies in pom.xml
download and auto-configuration the module as you included in pom.xml

dwonlaod  haar baar nhi hoga jb maven reload or build kre ge tbhi download hoga.
Ex: We have to create a web application then we have to put spring-boot-starter-web dependency in pox.xml 
when we start the project springboot download all the dependency require for web
and configure  the things like spring mvc.

4)HOw spring boot starts?
1)Start by caliing main method of main class
2)The run method of springApplication is called .the method starts the application
by creating an application context and initializing it.

#)what is annotians?



#)Top Spring boot Annotaions

1)@SpringBootApplication
This annotation combination  of three annotations
@Configuration ->we can configuration bean
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@ComponentScan ->here we want to check in package ke andar component  hai kya.
it is typically placed on the main class of the application.

#)@Component -> it is used to  mark a class as a spring bean that
will be managed by the spring container.

@Autowired: This annotion is used to automatically inject dependencies into
 a Spring-mangedbean.
Example likho kaise krte oh?
#)@Service:
This annotiaon is used to indicate that a class represent a service component in the application .it is typically used to annotate classes that 
contain business logic.

#)@RestController
Mark class as Rest Controller .it is a specialized version of the 
@Controller annotation that includes the @ResponseBody annotation by default.


#)@RequestMapping :used to map  specific url to method .Used on class as well as method level.
is used to map an HTTP request (like GET, POST, etc.) to a method or a class in a controller.
#)When this URL is called, run this method.


@ResponseBody

#)@Repository :mark class a DAO .mostly used on class that has databse persistent logic.

#)Wht are the spring boot starters?
Startes are a collection of pre-configured dependecncies that makes it a easier  to develop  particular kinds of applications










Bean ->
--------------------------------------------------------------------
#)How Spring Finds @Component Beans

Spring scans your project (using @ComponentScan) and automatically detects any class annotated with:

@Component

@Service

@Repository

@Controller

@RestController

This usually happens automatically in Spring Boot, because @SpringBootApplication includes @ComponentScan.

#)What are the Spring boot starters
Starters are a collection of pre-configured depencies that makes
it easier to develop particular kinds of aoolications.
spring-boot-starter-web => web se related sare  configuraiton and dependecy rlhu jaise  hi use kiya sb jldi se downlaod ho jata hai.
#) These startes include all of the dependecies ,version control and configarion needed to amke certain features of a speing boot  applicaiton funcitonal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
#)What are the key dependecies of spring boot?
1)spring boot-starter-parent(provide defualt configuraiton for spring-based applicziton)
Provide the dfualt compiler leevel as java 1.8 and UTF-8 source
provide defualt config for maven plugis such as maven-surfire

2)maven-plugin
3)sarter-test
4)starter-actuator
5)starter-web


#)maven

Q)Can we use only Spring boot dependecy feature  and configure  maven plugin manually?
1)Yes
2)

Q)What is spring boot cli and what are its benfits?
comamnd tool to creat run and amange spring boot applicasiotn
-->Spring
-->spring help init
--> spring version
-->Spring init --dependecncies=web data-jpa my-project
-->spring init --list
->spring  init -d web cli-project


Q)What  is Thymeleaf?
java -based server side  templating engine used in java web applications to
render dynamic web pages.
In order to use dynamic  template html then we use themleaf.
