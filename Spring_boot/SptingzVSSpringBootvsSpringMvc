#)What is the difference between Spring and Spring Boot?
#)Why spring boot over spring?
Feature	            Spring	                    Spring Boot
Configuration	Manual (XML or Java-based)	        Auto-configuration
Setup	        Complex	                          Very simple
Server	        External	                      Embedded
Dependency Management	Manual	                Spring Boot Starters
Deployment	    WAR	                                JAR (standalone)

1)what is springboot?
->Spring Boot is java framework that makes it easier to create and run java applicaitons.
->it simplifies the configuraion and setup process allowing devlopers to focus moore
 in writing code for their applicatins.
->Spring boot  a module of the spring framework ,it helps us rapid application development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
->Spring boot solve many problem
a)No Beans xml based configuration
b)Dependecy Mangement
Projet bna rha   web ki depenedecy chayiye (spring-boot-starter-web)
pom.xml daal denge apne app saridepenedency a jaye gi..auto configuraiotn noo need to do 
any other configarion ..only we have to use annotation and ready to go.
c)Embedded Server
It also provide embed server(Earlie we need to  do lot of congiguration on tomacat server set).
#)what is embedded server?
#)Concept of embedserve it hels in deploying our jar in easy way
#)Default is Tomcat
#)we can put other server also by removint the current one  and it otehr

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
#)What is an Embedded Server? (Simple Answer)
An embedded server means the web server (like Tomcat, Jetty) is built inside the Spring Boot application JAR.
We don’t need to install or deploy the server separately.
Just run the JAR, and the server starts automatically.

✅ Example
In traditional Java:

❌ You need to install Tomcat on your machine
❌ Deploy WAR file into webapps folder
❌ Restart server manually

---------------------------------------
In Spring Boot:
✅ Just run:
java -jar myapp.jar


Spring Boot automatically starts an internal server:
Embedded Tomcat (default)
Or Jetty
Or Undertow
----------------------------------------------------
✅ Why is it called embedded?

Because the server is:
✅ Included inside your JAR
✅ Started by Spring Boot automatically
✅ Managed by your application, not separately

✅ Simple real example

Spring Boot uses this dependency:

#)spring-boot-starter-web

It includes:

✅ Embedded Tomcat
✅ That means Tomcat runs inside your application JAR file.

---------------------------------------------------------------
✅ Advantages of Embedded Server
✅ 1. No need to install external Tomcat
Everything is packaged.
✅ 2. Easy deployment
Just run the JAR anywhere.
✅ 3. Simplifies DevOps and microservices
Every service runs independently with its own server.
✅ 4. Faster startup
Because no WAR deployment is needed.
✅ 5. Supports microservice architecture
Each microservice has its own server.
✅ Simple interview line

“An embedded server is a server bundled inside the Spring Boot application.
When we run the JAR, the server starts automatically.
No external Tomcat installation or WAR deployment is required.”

-------------------------------------------------------------
✅ If interviewer asks: Which server does Spring Boot use?
Default Embedded Server:
✅ Tomcat
But you can switch to:
Jetty
Undertow

----------------------------------------------------------------------
1)Spring boot provide  many adavantages over  normal spring framework.

a) Easy to use -Remove boilerplate codes.
b)Production Ready application: Metrix ,health Check and many features aredesignes for produiton ready applicaiotn.
c)Rapid devlopemnt : Auto configuration enable develoers to quickly dvleop apps.
d)Provide Dependency Mangemnt : no need to manager separate dependices manually.in spring we need to manage depencies manualy
e)AutoConfiguration:Springboot autoconfiguration things by default.
f)Embedded server:Provide tomatserver by default. we don't need to manullay configuaration.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3)Working of spring boot?
1)Spring boot starts by scanning the starter dependencies in pom.xml
download and auto-configuration the module as watever we  included in pom.xml

dwonlaod  haar baar nhi hoga jb maven reload or build kre ge tbhi download hoga.
Ex: We have to create a web application then we have to put spring-boot-starter-web dependency in pom.xml 
when we start the project springboot download all the dependency require for web
and configure  the things like spring mvc.









------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem sring solves 
1)Duplicate code
2) Good integration with other Framework.
