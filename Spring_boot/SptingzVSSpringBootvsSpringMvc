Configuration	Manual (XML or Java-based)	 Auto-configuration
Setup	        Complex	                          Very simple
Server	        External	                      Embedded
Dependency Management	Manual	                Spring Boot Starters
Deployment	    WAR	                                JAR (standalone)
