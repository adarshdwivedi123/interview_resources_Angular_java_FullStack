1)Instance Variable :instance varible declare  at class leve we can acces inside the mehtod any where
insstwcen class ke bhar  hm object bna ke use kre ge
2)instance varible get memory at a run time 
instacen varible take some space 
int a;
System.out.println(a);
3)It is associated with an object, so each object of the class has its own copy of the instance variable.
Stored in the heap memory, since objects are stored in heap.



Key Characteristics

Scope → Accessible by all methods, constructors, and blocks inside the class (via the object).

Lifetime → Created when an object is created, destroyed when the object is destroyed (garbage collected).

Default Values → Unlike local variables, instance variables get default values (e.g., 0 for int, null for objects, false for boolean).

Memory → Stored in the heap memory, since objects are stored in heap.

Access → Can use access modifiers (public, private, etc.).

Object-specific → Each object has its own copy of instance variables (unless they are declared static).


#)Where are instance variables stored?
Answer:
Instance variables are stored in the heap memory, since objects themselves are stored in heap.
 Each object has its own separate space for instance variables.


#)Why are instance variables stored in heap and not stack?
Answer:
Because the lifetime of an object is independent of the method call.
 A stack frame is destroyed when a method ends, but objects may still exist in memory and be referenced elsewhere.
  Since instance variables belong to objects, they must live in the heap along with the object.

  Example

  class Student {
    // 👇 Instance variables
    String name;
    int age;

    void setDetails(String n, int a) {
        name = n; // assigning to instance variable
        age = a;
    }

    void display() {
        System.out.println("Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Age: " + age);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating two objects
        Student s1 = new Student();
        Student s2 = new Student();

        s1.setDetails("Adarsh", 22);
        s2.setDetails("Rahul", 25);

        s1.display(); // Output: Name: Adarsh, Age: 22
        s2.display(); // Output: Name: Rahul, Age: 25
    }
}
