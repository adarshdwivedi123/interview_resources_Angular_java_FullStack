#)Array
• Array is an object which contains elements of similar data type
• Array is a container object that hold values of homogeneous type.
• Array is also known as static data structure because size of an array
must be specified at the time of its declaration.
• Array starts from zero index and goes to n-1 where n is length of the
array.
• Array in Java is index-based, the first element of the array is stored
at the 0th index, 2nd element is stored on 1st index and so on.
• In Java, array is treated as an object and stores into heap memory. It
allows to store primitive values or reference values.

#)Syntax
dataType[] arr;
dataType []arr;
dataType arr[];


Instantiation of Array
dataType[] arr = new dataType[size];

public class ArrayDemo{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        int[] arr = new int[5];
        for(int x : arr){
            System.out.println(x);
        }
    }
}
it will print the default values of int array that is 0 0000
Here, we are assigning values at the time of array creation. It is useful
when we want to store static data into the array
#) int[] arr={10,20,30,40,50};

#)find the length of an array
arr.length
int[] myArray = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
System.out.println("Length of the array: " + myArray.length);
