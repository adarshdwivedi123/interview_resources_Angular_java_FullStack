#)Process Based Multitasking:()
Executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a separate independent process 
Example:
Process :IN winodws we are running multiple program run sepeartely
In a system if  multiple program run separateltely 
for exm paint chl rtha hai and vlc  intelliz.

(#)Thread based multitasking:
Executing several tasks simultaneously where each task is a separate independent part of
the same program
in zoom we are able to   listen audion and video and screen these independent task we are able
to do in same program this is called thread based multitasking.
each independent part is called a thread.

#)How to know where should  i use multithreading?
multithreading use 
ThreadSchduler =>
1)t.start()  new thread is created and this new threaded is responsible for executing the run() method.
2) on the other hand if we use run() no new  thread is created the run() method is  excured like a regaular  by main started

#)Thread Priorities
In Java, threads can have different priorities that indicate their importance to the thread
scheduler. Thread priorities are represented by integer values ranging from 1 to 10, where 1
is the lowest priority and 10 is the highest priority. The default priority for a thread is usually
inherited from its parent thread.
Thread class defines the following constants to represent some standard priorities.
• Thread. MIN_PRIORITY----------1
• Thread. MAX_PRIORITY----------10
• Thread. NORM_PRIORITY--------5 


The  methods to prevent a thread form excursion
1)Yield()
2)join()  ==> This method allow on thread to wait for the completion of another thread
3)Sleep() => If we want to make current to sleep for sometime we can use it.

ThreadYield => Behaviour is not fixed might be due yield other thread ko jda baar chance mil jaye(THis method we are not using  always )

#)What is the use of join() method in Threads?
💬 Simple Explanation:

The join() method is used to make one thread wait for another thread to finish its execution before continuing.

In other words —
➡️ If thread A calls threadB.join(), then A will pause until thread B finishes.

class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
            System.out.println("Child Thread: " + i);
            try { Thread.sleep(500); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
        }
    }
}

public class JoinExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyThread t = new MyThread();
        t.start();

        try {
            // Main thread waits for child thread to finish
            t.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Main Thread finished after Child Thread.");
    }
}
🧠 Explanation:
The main thread starts the child thread t.

Then main calls t.join(), so it waits until t completes.

Only after the child thread finishes, the main thread prints its final line.

What is Thread Safety?

Thread-safe code means that the code behaves correctly when accessed by multiple threads at the same time,
 without causing unexpected behavior like data corruption or crashes.
