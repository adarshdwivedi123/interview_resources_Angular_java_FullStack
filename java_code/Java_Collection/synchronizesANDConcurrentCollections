#)Difference between Synchronized and Concurrent Collections in Java

In Java, thread safety can be achieved in two ways:
Because both are thread safe
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Synchronized Collections
Drawbacks:

Global locking on the collection object

#)Only one thread can access the collection at a time
whole segment is locked  by this thread and other threads have to wait in Synchrnozied collection.

#)Can lead to performance bottlenecks in high-concurrency scenarios

what  we use see in pcihce mondya 5
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Concurrent Collections

Part of the java.util.concurrent package

#)allowing multiple threads to read/write without 
locking the whole collection Better performance in multithreaded environments
