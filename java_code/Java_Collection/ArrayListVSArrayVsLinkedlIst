#)List
The List interface in Java is part of the Collection framework.
List we can store the duplicate element



#)What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?

Array
1)A fixed-size data structure that holds elements of the same type.
2)Can store primitive types (e.g., int, char)
3)Faster for accessing elements (index-based
4)No built-in methods (manual handling for add, remove, etc.).
int[] arr = new int[5]



#)ArrayLIst
1)A dynamic collection (interface) that can grow or shrink in size.
2)Can store only objects (e.g., Integer, String).
3)Has many built-in methods (add(), remove(), contains(), etc.).

List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
1)Array size is fixed — once created, you can’t change its length.
2)List size is flexible — you can add or remove elements anytime.
3)Array can store primitive types like int, char, etc.
4)List can only store objects, like Integer, String, etc.
5)Array doesn’t have built-in methods.
6)List has many helper methods — like add(), remove(), contains() etc.


4).What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedLis
t?

“Both ArrayList and LinkedList are classes that implement the List interface in Java.
The main difference is how they store data.
ArrayList uses a dynamic array internally, so it’s fast for accessing elements because it allows direct access using an index.
But inserting or deleting elements, especially in the middle, is slow since elements have to be shifted.

On the other hand, LinkedList uses a doubly linked list, so it’s fast for insertion and deletion, as it just changes the links between nodes.
However, accessing elements is slower, because it needs to traverse from the beginning.
So, I would prefer ArrayList when I need fast access, and LinkedList when I need frequent insertions or deletions.”


How do you iterate around an ArrayList using Iterator?

🗣️ Answer:

You can use the Iterator interface to traverse through an ArrayList.

📘 Example:

ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("A"); list.add("B"); list.add("C");

Iterator<String> it = list.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
    System.out.println(it.next());

 #)How do you sort an ArrayList?
🗣️ Answer:
You can use Collections.sort() to sort an ArrayList in ascending order.
📘 Example:
ArrayList<Integer> nums = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(3, 1, 2));
Collections.sort(nums);
System.out.println(nums); // [1, 2, 3]   

---------------------------------------------------------

ArrayList<Integer>nums =new ArrayList<>(Arrrays.asList(3,1,2));
Collections.sort(num)
