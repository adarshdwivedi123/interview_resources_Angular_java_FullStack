What is difference between fail-safe and fail-fast iterators?
147. What are the important interfaces related to the Set interface?
Interface	Description
SortedSet	Maintains elements in sorted (ascending) order
NavigableSet	Extends SortedSet and adds navigation methods like lower(), higher()
Collection	Parent interface of Set
Set	The base interface implemented by all sets

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
148. What is the difference between Set and SortedSet interfaces?
Feature	Set	SortedSet
Order	No order guaranteed	Maintains ascending sorted order
Nulls	Allows one null (depends on impl)	Usually does not allow nulls
Implementations	HashSet, LinkedHashSet	TreeSet
Methods	Basic collection methods	Extra methods like first(), last(), headSet(), tailSet()
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🏗️ 149. Can you give examples of classes that implement the Set interface?

✅ Implementations:

HashSet

LinkedHashSet

TreeSet (implements NavigableSet, which extends SortedSet)

EnumSet

CopyOnWriteArraySet

Fail-Fast vs Fail-Safe Iterators

Iterators are used to traverse collections in Java.
 Fail-fast and fail-safe describe how iterators behave when the underlying collection is modified during iteration.

1. Fail-Fast Iterator

Fail-fast iterators throw a ConcurrentModificationException when one tries to modify 
the collection while iterating over it.

🧩 Example:

List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("A");
list.add("B");
list.add("C");

Iterator<String> it = list.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
    String s = it.next();
    if (s.equals("B")) {
        list.remove(s); // ❌ Throws ConcurrentModificationException
    }
}

2. Fail-Safe Iterator

Fail-safe iterators do not throw ConcurrentModificationException
 when the collection is modified during iteration.
They work on a copy of the collection, not the original.

✅ Key Points:

Works on clone of collection

Safe for concurrent modifications

Found in concurrent collections: ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, ConcurrentLinkedQueue

Slower for large collections (because of copy overhead)

🧩 Example:

CopyOnWriteArrayList<String> list = new CopyOnWriteArrayList<>();
list.add("A");
list.add("B");
list.add("C");

Iterator<String> it = list.iterator();
while (it.hasNext()) {
    String s = it.next();
    if (s.equals("B")) {
        list.remove(s); // ✅ No exception
    }
}

System.out.println(list); // [A, C]


#)Blocking Queue
It is thread-safe queue that blocks the operations when the queue is full or empty.
It is part of java.util.concurrent package.
multiplethread canbe inserting and removing elements concurrently from a java blocking queue without
 any concurrency issues arrisng.
