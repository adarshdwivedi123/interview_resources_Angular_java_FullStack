#)Post-Increment (Ex: a ++): Value is first used for computing the result and
then incremented.
#)Pre-Increment (Ex: ++ a): Value is incremented first and then the result is
computed.
#)Post-decrement (Ex: a--): Value is first used for computing the result and
then decremented
#)Pre-decrement (Ex: --a): Value is decremented first and then the result is
computed.

Imp Points about Increment and Decrement operators
• Can only be applied to variables only
• Nesting of both operators is not allowed
• They are not operated over final variables
• Increment and Decrement Operators cannot be applied to Boolean
