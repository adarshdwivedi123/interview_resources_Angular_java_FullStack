#)Java String Pool

In Java, the String Pool is a special memory region inside the heap that stores string literals.
When we create a string using double quotes, like "Hello", Java first checks the pool.
If the string already exists in the pool, it reuses the same object.
If not, it adds the new string to the pool.
This helps improve memory efficiency and performance, especially 
when working with many duplicate strings.


#)What does immutable mean for Strings?
In Java, strings are immutable, which means once a String object is created, it cannot be changed.
 Any operation that seems to modify a string actually creates a new string object instead of changing the original one

#)Example
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String original = "Hello";
        String modified = original.concat(" World");

        System.out.println("Original String: " + original);
        System.out.println("Modified String: " + modified);
    }
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#)Explanation
original points to the string "Hello".

When we call original.concat(" World"), it does NOT change the original string.

Instead, it creates a new string "Hello World" and assigns it to modified.

So, printing original still outputs "Hello", showing the string itself was not changed.


--------------------------------------------------
#)Why is this important?
Immutability makes strings thread-safe.
It enables string pooling to save memory.
Prevents unexpected side effects since strings can’t be changed once created.



--------------------------------Mutable Vs IMutable-------------------

// Immutable String
String s1 = "Hello";
String s2 = s1.concat(" World");

System.out.println(s1); // Hello
System.out.println(s2); // Hello World

// Mutable StringBuilder
StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder("Hello");
sb1.append(" World");

System.out.println(sb1.toString()); // Hello World



Note:
“Immutable objects like String are great for thread safety 
and predictable behavior because their state can’t change once created.
 Mutable objects like StringBuilder are preferred when you need to change data frequently,
like concatenating strings in loops, 
to improve performance by avoiding creating many intermediate objects.”



#)ThreadSafe

public class ThreadSafeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String sharedString = "Hello";

        Runnable task = () -> {
            // Multiple threads reading the same immutable string
            System.out.println(sharedString.toUpperCase());
        };

        Thread t1 = new Thread(task);
        Thread t2 = new Thread(task);

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}


You create a shared immutable string "Hello".

You create two threads (t1 and t2), both executing the same task: print sharedString.toUpperCase().

Since String is immutable, both threads just read the same object and convert it to uppercase.

The threads run concurrently, but since the operation doesn’t modify any shared data, there are no conflicts or inconsistencies.
