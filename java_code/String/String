 1)String is an object that represents sequence of characters.
 2)One important thing to notice about string object is that string objects
are immutable that means once a string object is created it cannot be
changed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#)How to create String object in Java?
-> To handle string data in Java, we need an object of string class.
Basically, there are three ways to create a String object in Java.
1) By string literal.
2) By new keyword.
3) By converting character arrays into strings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#)Working with String literal
-> String literal in Java is created by using double quotes.
String str = "hello";
-> The string literal is always created in the string constant pool.
-> In Java, String constant pool is a special area that is used for storing
string objects.
#)String are immutbale?
-> Whenever we create a string literal in Java, JVM checks string constant
pool first. If the string already exists in string constant pool, no new string
object will be created in the string pool by JVM.

-> JVM uses the same string object by pointing a reference to it to save
memory. But if string does not exist in the string pool, JVM creates a new
string object and placed it in the pool.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#)WHy string OBjects are given as immutable Objects?
Immutable means once an object is created, its state (data) cannot be changed.
So when you change a string in Java, you’re not modifying the original object —
you’re actually creating a new String object in memory.

String s = "Adarsh";
s.concat(" Dwivedi");
System.out.println(s); // Output: Adarsh
Here, "Adarsh Dwivedi" is a new String object, but s still refers to "Adarsh".


2)String Pool (Performance & Memory Efficiency)

Java uses a String Constant Pool (SCP) to store unique String literals.

Example:
for exm when we declare a varbale with this 
String s1 = "Hello";
String s2 = "Hello";


Both s1 and s2 point to the same object in the SCP.

If Strings were mutable, then changing one string (s1) would affect others (s2), causing unpredictable behavior.
Immutability ensures that strings in the pool remain consistent and safe to share.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#)Benfit of immutability

1️⃣ Security
Strings are used in many sensitive places — e.g.:

String username = "root";
String password = "1234";
DriverManager.getConnection(dbURL, username, password);


2)If String were mutable, someone could change the password value after it’s passed to a method, which could lead to security breaches.
Immutability ensures that once created, the data can’t be altered.


#)Thread Safety
Since String objects cannot be changed, they are automatically thread-safe.
Multiple threads can use the same String without synchronization issues.

#)What is toString()?
toString() is a method in Java that returns a text (string) that describes an object.
Every class in Java gets this method from the Object class (because all classes inherit from it).

or

toString() is used to show object information as text instead of showing its memory address.

#)Why we use it?
We use toString() when we want to see the details of an object in a readable way — like printing it using System.out.println().


#)Example (without overriding)
class Student {
    int id = 1;
    String name = "Adarsh";
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student();
        System.out.println(s1);
    }
}


🧾 Output:
Student@5ca881b5

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
we need to ovveride toStringMethod() then we are  able print object otehr wise print memory address 
which is hard to read.

Example (with overriding)
class Student {
    int id = 1;
    String name = "Adarsh";

    public String toString() {
        return "Student[id=" + id + ", name=" + name + "]";
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Student s1 = new Student();
        System.out.println(s1);
    }
}

🧾 Output:
Student[id=1, name=Adarsh]


-----------------------------------------------------------------


#)In Java, a superclass reference variable can hold an object of a subclass.
Superclass (Parent Class) → The class whose properties and methods are inherited by another class.
Subclass (Child Class) → The class that inherits from a superclass and can have additional properties or methods.
This is called upcasting.
class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal eats");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog eats");
    }
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();  // Superclass reference, subclass object
        a.eat();               // Calls overridden method in Dog
        // a.bark();           // ❌ Error: cannot call subclass-specific methods
    }
}
