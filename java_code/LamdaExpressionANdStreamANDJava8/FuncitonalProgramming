#)What is Functional Programming in Java?

Functional programming in Java means writing code using functions instead of classes and objects
 to perform actions. It focuses on what to do, not how to do it.
From Java 8, we can use 

1)lambda expressions 
2)Stream API to write cleaner and shorter code.

It was introduced in Java 8 through lambdas, streams, and functional interfaces.
 It allows us to write cleaner and more readable code by focusing on what to do rather than how to do it.”

Before Java 8 (Imperative Style):

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
for (Integer n : numbers) {
    if (n % 2 == 0) {
        System.out.println(n);
    }
}


With Functional Programming (Java 8+):

List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.stream()
       .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
       .forEach(System.out::println);
