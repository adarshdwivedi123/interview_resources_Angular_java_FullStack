Function:
FUnciton is exactly same as predicates except that functions can return any type of result but 
function should (can) return  only one vlaue and  that value can be  any type as per requirement.

here in fucniton we passing multiple argument
Funciton<String ,Integer> i=s->s.length();


Predicate   
1)TO implment conditional checks we should go for predicate
2)Predicate<T>can take only one type parameter and  it rep inputtype
3)it has only one method test()
4)only return boolean value(T/F)


1)Funcitons
1)To perform some operation and return some result.
2)Function<T,R> can two argument
3)it has only one method applyu
4)can return any type of value
