#)What is Garbage Collection?

In Java, Garbage Collection (GC) is the process of automatically freeing up memory 
by removing objects that are no longer reachable (i.e., not referenced by any variable).

#)wht is memory leak?
A memory leak happens when objects are no longer needed but still referenced,
 so the garbage collector cannot remove them.
 
#) Use try-with-resources
#)Remove listeners
Avoid static large objects
Use WeakReference/WeakHashMap
Clean unused collections
#)Nullify References
Inside long-lived classes, set references to null after use.
obj = null;
#)Use memory profiling tools
Avoid static large objects
Use WeakReference/WeakHashMap
Clean unused collections
Use memory profiling tools
