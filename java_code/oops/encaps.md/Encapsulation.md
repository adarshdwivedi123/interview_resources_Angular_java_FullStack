#)Encapsulation in java is  process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.restricting direct access to the data.

Exmple:
A capsule which is mixed of several medicine.(jo cpasule hota hai voe ake hi medicnie ke andar bind hota hai) 

It means —
You hide the internal details of how data is stored or modified and expose only necessary behavior through methods (getters/setters)

How Encapsulation Achieves Data Hiding

#)Encapsulation achieves data hiding using access modifiers (especially private) and getter/setter methods.
#)Also know as DATA-HIding
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps to acheive Encapsulation
1)Declare Varibale of a class as private
2) Provide a Public getter and setter method.

we can create  a fully encapsulated class in java by making all the data memeber of the class private and now we can use setter and getter method  to set and get data in it .


Advantage
#)Lossely couple code  (Not dependent on each other)
#)Better access control and secuirty

public class InnerEncapsulation {
    }

public class Encapsulation {

}
