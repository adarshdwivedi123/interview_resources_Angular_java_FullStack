1. Interpreter: Translates code line-by-line.
2. Compiler: Translates entire code at once.
3. Assembler: Converts assembly language to machine code.



Class And Object:
Class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.
Example: Think of a class as the blueprint of a house. The blueprint itself isn't a house,
but it details the design and features of the house.

Object An instance of a class.
Example: An object is like a real house made from the blueprint. Each house can look
the same but is a separate, physical thing.


#)State

1)The state of an object represents its data or attributes — i.e., what values it holds at a particular time.
class Car {
    String color;
    int speed;
}

Now if we create an object:

java
Copy code
Car car1 = new Car();
car1.color = "Red";
car1.speed = 120;

#)State of car1:
color = "Red"
speed = 120
If you change these variables, you change the state of the object.



2️⃣ Behavior of an Object
The behavior of an object represents what the object can do — i.e., its methods or functions.
👉 In simple words: Behavior = actions (methods) that operate on state.

#)class Car {
    String color;
    int speed;

    void accelerate() {
        speed += 10;
    }

    void brake() {
        speed -= 10;
    }
}


#)accelerate() and brake() represent the behavior of the Car object.
#)They change the state (i.e., modify the speed).

#)What is the super class of every class in Java?
The superclass of every class in Java is java.lang.Object.

Explanation:
In Java, all classes implicitly inherit from the Object class, either directly or indirectly.
That means even if you don’t explicitly extend any class, your class automatically extends Object.
