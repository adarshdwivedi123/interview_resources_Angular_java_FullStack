BHut easy we scure communication kr skte hai between client and  server.
In jwt there are three part 
dot se phele 
1)Header
2)Payload

#)what is monolithic architecture?
1)if we develop all functionlaity  in sngle  project then it is called
monolithic architecture based app.
2)We will package our app as jar/war to deploy into server.
3)Target  -->jar  --> all module
4)As monolithic app contains all functionality .it will become  fat jar.


#)Advantage
1)Simple to develop.
2)Everything is available in one place
3)configuration require only once.


#)DIS:Advantage
1)Difficult to maintain
2)Dependices among  the functionalities 
3)Single Point of failure
4)Entire project deployment




TO overcome the problem of monolithic ,Microservice architecture  came into picture
1)Microservices is not prog lang
2)Microservices is not a  framework
3)Microservicex is not an specification api.
4)Microservices is an architecture design pattern.
5)microservices suggesting to  develop app functionalities with loosely coupling.



#)ake  service dusre pe dependent is called tight coupling.
#)NOn dependet then called  loose coupliong.


Advantages

1)Loosely couping
2)Easy to mantain
3)Quick development and deployment
4)Less downtime
5)Technology independent
6)


Secure Key
1)SHA
2)

#)Microservices Architeture

1)Service Registery
2)Service
3)Api gateway
4)Load Balancer
5)Admin Server
6)ZipKin Server & sleuth.



Service Registry:
1) Service Registry act as  db of services available in th project
2)It provides the details of all services which are registered with service registry.
3)we czan use ""eurek


#)Steps For Microservices
web
Eureka Server (First Select this option)
Spring boot dev tools (Ctrls +s  kre ge automatica reload)



#) Actuator Production me  monitor tool ke liye use krte
#) Actuator  is Just add dependency 
codecentric's Spring Boot Admin (Server) Ops
A community project to manage and monitor your Spring Boot



Cors =>two differn domain  cannot communicate directly .
ake domain ka data mai bina domain ke margi ke avu ga to isko bole ge resource sharing without
permisiion.
