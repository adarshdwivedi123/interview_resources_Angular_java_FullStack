In C and C++ applications, memory will be allocated for primitive data types at
compilation time only, not at runtime.

• If any programming language allows memory allocation for primitive data types
at runtime, not at compilation time then that programming language is called as
Dynamic Programming Language.
EX: JAVA

• In java applications, memory will be allocated for primitive data types at runtime
only, not at compilation time.

• Note: In Java applications, memory will be allocated for primitive data types at
the time of creating objects only, in java applications, objects are created at
runtime only
