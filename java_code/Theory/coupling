🔹 What is Coupling?

Coupling in Java (and in OOP in general) means how much one class or module depends on another.
If two classes are tightly coupled, they depend heavily on each other.
If they are loosely coupled, they depend less on each other.

or
Coupling is a measure of how much a class is dependent on other classes. There should minimal
dependencies between classes. So, we should always aim for low coupling between classes.

🔸 Example of Tight Coupling:
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine starts");
    }
}

class Car {
    Engine engine = new Engine(); // direct dependency

    void startCar() {
        engine.start(); // tightly coupled to Engine
    }
}


👉 Here, Car is tightly coupled with Engine because:

It creates the Engine object itself.

If Engine changes, the Car class may also need to change.

🔸 Example of Loose Coupling (Better Design):
class Engine {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Engine starts");
    }
}

class Car {
    private Engine engine; // reference passed from outside

    Car(Engine engine) {   // constructor injection
        this.engine = engine;
    }

    void startCar() {
        engine.start();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Engine e = new Engine();
        Car c = new Car(e); // Engine passed from outside
        c.startCar();
    }
}


👉 Now Car is loosely coupled with Engine because:

It doesn’t create the Engine object itself.

You can pass different types of engines (like ElectricEngine, DieselEngine) easily.

🔹 Why Loose Coupling is Better

✅ Easier to maintain
✅ Easier to test (mock objects can be used)
✅ More flexible (works with different classes)
✅ Follows good OOP principles (like Dependency Injection)
