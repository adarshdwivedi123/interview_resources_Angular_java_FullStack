What is the use of instanceof operator in Java?
instanceof operator checks if an object is of a particular type.
The instanceof operator in Java is used to check whether an object is an instance of a particular class or subclass.

It returns a boolean value:

true → if the object is of that type (or subclass type)

false → otherwise

class Animal {}
class Dog extends Animal {}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a = new Dog();

        System.out.println(a instanceof Dog);     // true
        System.out.println(a instanceof Animal);  // true
        System.out.println(a instanceof Object);  // true
        System.out.println(a instanceof String);  // false
    }
}



Why do we use instanceof?

✅ Type checking before casting
It helps prevent ClassCastException when doing downcasting.

if (a instanceof Dog) {
    Dog d = (Dog) a; // Safe cast
    System.out.println("Downcasting done safely");
}


✅ Useful in inheritance and polymorphism
To check which subclass object you’re dealing with at runtime.

✅ Used in method overriding
Sometimes used to perform different actions depending on the actual object type.
