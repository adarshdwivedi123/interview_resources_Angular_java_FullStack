#)The Collection interface extends Iterable and defines basic methods like
1)add,
2)remove,
3)and size.

It has three main subinterfaces:
List → ordered, allows duplicates (like ArrayList, LinkedList)
Set → unique elements, no duplicates (like HashSet, TreeSet)
Queue → holds elements for processing, usually FIFO (like LinkedList, PriorityQueue)


#)What are the important methods declared in the Collection interface?
🗣️ Sample Interview Answer:

“The Collection interface provides common methods that are implemented by all its subclasses.
Some important ones are:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
add() → to add elements
remove() → to delete elements
size() → to get total number of elements
isEmpty() → to check if collection is empty
contains() → to check if an element exists
iterator() → to iterate through elements
toArray() → to convert collection to array
clear() → to remove all elements.”
