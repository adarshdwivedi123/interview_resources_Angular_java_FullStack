#)Difference between Synchronized and Concurrent Collections in Java

In Java, thread safety can be achieved in two ways:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Synchronized Collections

Achieved by wrapping collections using Collections.synchronizedXXX() methods.

Example: Collections.synchronizedList(new ArrayList<>())

Drawbacks:

Global locking on the collection object

Only one thread can access the collection at a time

Can lead to performance bottlenecks in high-concurrency scenarios
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Concurrent Collections

Part of the java.util.concurrent package

Designed for high-concurrency, allowing multiple threads to read/write without locking the whole collection

Better performance in multithreaded environments
