Polymorphism is a programming concept that allows for the same code to be
used with different data types. This is achieved by using inheritance and method
overriding.
Type of polymorphism
1. Overloading
2. Overriding

public class Polymorphism {
    
}

class Test {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}


#)Overloading
Compile time polymorphism

#)Method overloading means declaring multiple methods with same method
name but having different method signature.

#)Compile-time polymorphism (decided at compile time).

In method overloading while writing the method signature we have to follow
following 3 Rules

• Method name must be same for all methods
• List of parameters must be different like different type of parameters,
different
number of parameters, different order of parameters.
• Return type is not considered in method overloading; it means we never
decide method overloading with return type.

Ask 
Overloading requires different parameters, not just different return types.
