JDK, JRE, and JVM
#)JDK (Java Development Kit)
• Role: It's the tool for making Java programs.
o How It Works: The JDK includes a compiler to turn your Java code into a
format the computer can understand (bytecode).
• It also includes the JRE to test and run the programs you make.

#)JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
• Role: It's the setup needed to run Java programs.
o How It Works: The JRE includes libraries and components that help your
Java programs run.
• It includes the JVM, which is the part that actually runs your programs.

#)JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
• Role: It's the part that runs Java programs.
o How It Works: The JVM reads the bytecode (compiled Java code) and
translates it into machine code that your computer can execute.

How They Work Together:
JDK: You use it to write and compile Java programs.
JRE: Provides the environment and libraries needed to run Java programs.
JVM: The JVM reads the bytecode (compiled Java code) and
translates it into machine code that your computer can execute.
